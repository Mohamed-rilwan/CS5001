This directory contains some example code for a simple implementation of linked
lists, as shown in lectures.

From this directory, you can compile the code using the following commands:

    cd src
    javac uk/ac/standrews/cs/cs5001/tutor/*/*.java
    javac uk/ac/standrews/cs/cs5001/tutor/*.java

and then run some tests to demonstrate this code using the following:

    java uk.ac.standrews.cs.cs5001.tutor.Test
