This directory contains some example code for the use of lambda expressions.  It's the same as the LinkedList example, but when we create Visitor objects in the Test class, we show how to create VIsitors using lambda functions.

From this directory, you can compile the code using the following commands:

    cd src
    javac uk/ac/standrews/cs/cs5001/tutor/*/*.java
    javac uk/ac/standrews/cs/cs5001/tutor/*.java

and then run some tests to demonstrate this code using the following:

    java uk.ac.standrews.cs.cs5001.tutor.Test

The two lambda expressions can be seen in src/uk/ac/standrews/cs/cs5001/tutor/Test.java
